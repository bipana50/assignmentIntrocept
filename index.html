                <p class="question"><strong>1. What excites or interests you about coding? What did you learn this week?</strong></p>
                <p>The fact that we are able to write some commands and make something happen is simply amazing. The joy of representing idea and logic into output excites me the most. </p>
                <p>I have just started learning REACT framework, besides that i learnt more uses of version control tool(git), and different types of security options available for user login and some algorithms that are known to be secure than others.</p>

                <p class="question"><strong>2. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?</strong></p>
                <p>The most recently faced a problem on using multiple setintervals for a single game loop. I solved it after using only one setinterval loop for the whole program. Similarly, I also learned and used request animation frame instead of setinterval.</p>
